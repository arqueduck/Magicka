# 🎮 Magicka

**Magicka** is a 2D action game developed as a college project to explore the capabilities of the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library. The game was built to test concepts such as sprite animation, collision detection, game states (pause, game over, score), audio handling, and basic integration with a SQLite database for high score tracking.

## 🧪 About the Project

This project was developed for educational purposes as part of a college course, focusing on:

- Mastering the Pygame framework
- Structuring game loops and logic
- Handling input, rendering, music, and UI
- Implementing pause menus and countdown timers
- Saving and retrieving high scores using SQLite
- Building and distributing the game as a standalone `.exe`

## 💾 Requirements (Dev)

To run the project from source:

```bash
pip install pygame

```

Python 3.10+ is recommended. The game uses only Pygame and SQLite3, no extra dependencies required.

---

## 🛠️ Build & Distribution
This game was successfully compiled into a standalone .exe using:

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --windowed main.py --add-data "assets;assets"
```

Assets are stored in a folder named assets located beside the .exe for portability.
